I have a white cube, painted red on all sides. I cut it into 3x3x3 cubes. Now some sides of the smaller cubes are white and some red. I put them in a bag and mix them well. Now while you are blindfolded, I pick take out a random cube and roll it like a die. You take of your blindfold and see that all five sides visible to you are white. The sixth side faces the the table so you can not see it. What is the probabiltity that the sixth side is also white?
Please Reason step by step, and put your final awnser within \boxed{}.<think>
Alright, so I just came across this probability problem, and I want to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked here.

We start with a white cube that's painted red on all sides. So, initially, every face of the cube is red. Then, we cut this larger cube into smaller 3x3x3 cubes. That means we have 27 smaller cubes, right? Each of these smaller cubes has 6 faces, all initially red.

Now, I put all these 27 small cubes into a bag and mix them well. So, they're all randomly mixed up. Then, while someone is blindfolded, I take out a random cube from the bag and roll it like a die. After rolling, the person takes off their blindfold and sees that all five sides visible to them are white. The sixth side, which is facing the table, is not visible. The question is, what is the probability that the sixth side is also white?

Hmm, okay. So, essentially, after rolling the cube, we see five white faces, and we want to find the probability that the sixth hidden face is also white. Let me try to think through this.

First,
