I have a white cube, painted red on all sides. I cut it into 3x3x3 = 27 smaller cubes. Each of the smaller cubes has six sides, some red, some white. I put them in a bag and mix them well. Now while you are blindfolded, I pick take out a random cube and roll it like a die. You take of your blindfold and see that all five sides visible to you are white. The sixth side faces the table so you can not see it. What is the probabiltity that the sixth side is also white?
Please Reason step by step, and put your final awnser within \boxed{}.<think>
Okay, so I have this problem about a cube that's been painted and then cut into smaller cubes. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the cube is white and painted red on all sides. So, it's a standard cube with all six faces red. Then, it's cut into a 3x3x3 cube, which means it's divided into 27 smaller cubes. Each of these smaller cubes is like a tiny cube with some red and some white faces, depending on their position in the original cube.

Now, each of these 27 smaller cubes has six sides, some red, some white. The ones on the corners of the original cube will have three red faces, the ones on the edges (but not corners) will have two red faces, and the ones on the faces (but not edges or corners) will have one red face. The ones inside the cube, not on any face, will have no red faces at allâ€”they'll all be white.

So, when we take these 27 small cubes and put them in a bag, each cube is equally likely to be picked because they're all mixed up. Then, we're blindfolded, so we can't see which cube we're picking. We pick one at random and then roll it like a die. When we roll it, five sides are visible, and the sixth is on the table. We see that all five visible sides are white. The question is, what's the probability that the sixth side is also white?

Hmm, okay. So, we need to figure out, given that five sides are white, what's the probability that the sixth side is also white. That sounds like a conditional probability problem. So, we can use Bayes' theorem here.

First, let's figure out how many small cubes have all white sides. In the original cube, the small cubes can be categorized based on their position:

1. Corner cubes: Each corner cube has three red faces. So, they have three red sides and three white sides. There are 8 corner cubes in a cube.

2. Edge cubes (but not corners): Each edge has one cube in the middle, which has two red faces and four white faces. There are 12 edges on a cube, so 12 edge cubes.

3. Face cubes (but not edges or corners): Each face has one cube in the center, which has one red face and five white faces. There are 6 faces, so 6 face cubes.

4. Internal cubes: These are the cubes not on any face, so they have no red faces. There's only one internal cube in the original cube.

So, in total, 8 + 12 + 6 + 1 = 27, which checks out.

Now, when we pick a cube and see that five sides are white, we need to figure out how many of the cubes that could have five white sides are in the bag.

Let's think about each type of cube:

1. Corner cubes: Each corner cube has three red sides and three white sides. So, if we pick a corner cube, three sides are red and three are white. So, if we see five white sides, that would mean that the cube is a corner cube because it has three white sides. So, if we see five white sides, the cube must be a corner cube.

2. Edge cubes: Each edge cube has two red sides and four white sides. So, if we pick an edge cube, two sides are red and four are white. So, if we see five white sides, that would mean that the cube is an edge cube because it has four white sides. So, if we see five white sides, the cube must be an edge cube.

3. Face cubes: Each face cube has one red side and five white sides. So, if we pick a face cube, one side is red and five are white. So, if we see five white sides, that would mean that the cube is a face cube because it has five white sides. So, if we see five white sides, the cube must be a face cube.

4. Internal cubes: These have no red sides, so all six sides are white. So, if we pick an internal cube, all six sides are white. So, if we see five white sides, that could be either an internal cube or an edge cube or a face cube.

Wait, hold on. If we see five white sides, does that mean the cube is either a face cube, edge cube, or internal cube? Because all of these have five or six white sides.

But wait, the internal cube has all six sides white, so if we see five white sides, it could be either the internal cube or a face cube. Because a face cube has five white sides and one red side, so if we see five white sides, it could be a face cube or an internal cube.

Similarly, an edge cube has four white sides and two red sides, so if we see five white sides, it must be an edge cube.

So, to clarify:

- If we see five white sides, the cube could be:

    a) A corner cube: But wait, corner cubes have three white sides, so if we see five white sides, that can't be a corner cube.

    b) An edge cube: Edge cubes have four white sides, so if we see five white sides, that could be an edge cube.

    c) A face cube: Face cubes have five white sides, so if we see five white sides, that could be a face cube.

    d) An internal cube: All six sides are white, so if we see five white sides, that could be an internal cube.

Wait, so actually, if we see five white sides, the cube could be an edge cube, a face cube, or an internal cube. But a corner cube cannot have five white sides because it only has three.

So, the possible cubes that could have five white sides are edge cubes, face cubes, and internal cubes.

But wait, let me think again. If we have a cube that's an edge cube, it has two red sides and four white sides. So, if we see five white sides, that cube must be an edge cube because it has four white sides. Similarly, a face cube has five white sides, so if we see five white sides, it must be a face cube. An internal cube has six white sides, so if we see five white sides, it must be an internal cube.

But a corner cube has three white sides, so it can't have five white sides. So, the only cubes that can have five white sides are edge cubes, face cubes, and internal cubes.

So, now, we need to figure out how many of these cubes have five white sides, and how many of them have six white sides.

Wait, no. The internal cube has six white sides, so if we see five white sides, it could be either an internal cube or a face cube. Because a face cube has five white sides and one red side, so if we see five white sides, it could be a face cube or an internal cube.

Similarly, an edge cube has four white sides and two red sides, so if we
