Let me note that down: Betty has $50.\n\nNow, her parents are going to give her some money for the wallet. Her parents decided to give her $15. And then her grandparents are giving her twice as much as her parents. So, the grandparents are giving her $30 because twice $15 is $30. Wait, so why is she only getting $15 from her parents? Maybe the problem is not just about the total amount given but something else.\n\nLet me read the problem again carefully:\n\nBetty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100.
